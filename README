
Pyclewn allows using vim_ as a front end to a debugger. Pyclewn currently
supports gdb_ and pdb_.

The debugger output is redirected to a vim window, the pyclewn console. The
debugger commands are mapped to vim user-defined commands with a common letter
prefix, and with completion available on the commands and their first argument.

When pyclewn is started from vim with the ``:Pyclewn`` command on unix, the
``:Cinferiortty`` command launches a terminal connected to a pseudo terminal that
becomes the controlling terminal of the program being debugged by gdb or by
pdb.

Features
========

* A debugger command can be mapped in vim to a key sequence using vim key
  mappings. This allows, for example, to set/clear a breakpoint or print a
  variable value at the current cursor or mouse position by just hitting a
  key.

* Breakpoints and the line in the current frame, are highlighted in the source
  code. Disabled breakpoints are noted with a different highlighting color.
  Pyclewn automatically finds the source file for the breakpoint if it exists,
  and tells vim to load and display the file and highlight the line.

* Multiple consecutive pyclewn sessions can be started from within vim with
  the ``:Pyclewn`` command.

* The value of an expression or variable is displayed in a balloon in gvim when
  the mouse pointer is hovering over the selected expression or the variable.

pdb
---

* Pyclewn is a front-end to pdb-clone_. With breakpoints pyclewn runs just
  above the speed of the python interpreter (the command line python debugger,
  pdb, runs at 10 to 100 times the speed of the interpreter).

* Similarly to gdb, one may attach to a running python process with the pdb
  debugger, interrupt the process, manage a debugging session and terminate
  the debugging session by detaching from the process. A new debugging session
  may be conducted later on this same process, possibly from another Vim
  instance.

gdb
---

* An expression can be watched in a vim window. The expression value is
  updated and highlighted whenever it has changed. When the expression is a
  structure or class instance, it can be expanded (resp. folded) to show
  (resp. hide) its members and their values.

* A sequence of gdb commands can be run from a vim script when the ``async``
  option is set. This may be useful in a key mapping.

* The ``project`` command saves the current gdb settings to a project file
  that may be sourced later by the gdb ``source`` command. These settings are
  the working directory, the debuggee program file name, the program arguments
  and the breakpoints. The sourcing and saving of the project file can be
  automated to occur on each gdb startup and termination, with the
  ``project`` command line option.
