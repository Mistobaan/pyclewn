README - Pyclewn

Pyclewn is a python program that allows the use of gvim as a front end to a
debugger. Pyclewn currently supports gdb.

The debugger output is redirected to a vim window, the pyclewn console. The
debugger commands are mapped to vim user-defined commands with a common letter
prefix, and with completion available on the commands and their first
argument.

The controlling terminal of the program to debug is the terminal used to
launch pyclewn, or any other terminal when the debugger allows it (for
example, gdb with the attach and tty commands).


INSTALLATION:
------------
See INSTALL


DOCUMENTATION:
-------------
Read the user manual in runtime/doc/pyclewn.txt, or type the vim command
":help pyclewn" in vim once pyclewn has been installed.


FEATURES:
--------
* A debugger command can be mapped in vim to a key sequence using vim key
  mappings. This allows, for example, to set/clear a breakpoint or print a
  variable value at the current cursor or mouse position by just hitting a
  key.

* Breakpoints and the line in the current frame, are highlighted in the source
  code. Disabled breakpoints are noted with a different highlighting color.
  Pyclewn automatically finds the source file for the breakpoint if it exists,
  and tells vim to load and display the file and highlight the line.

* An expression value or a variable value is displayed in a balloon in vim,
  when the mouse pointer is hovering over the selected expression or the
  variable.

* Variables can be watched in a vim window. The variable value is updated and
  highlighted whenever changed.

* Vim command completion on the commands and their first argument.
