Writing Pyclewn Regression Tests
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The Pyclewn regression tests use the Python unittests framework. Refer to the
unittests package documentation, and to the README at
lib/pythonx.x/test/README in the Python distribution.

    * run all the test cases from the distribution root directory:

            ./regrtest.py

    * to obtain the logs of a single test in test_simple.py, for example,
      comment out all the other tests in test_main() in this file, and run the
      test file in verbose mode:

            ./regrtest.py -v test_simple.py

    * always start the test case by editing a file before running a Cxxx command

    * do not setup pyclewn as a daemon in a test case
