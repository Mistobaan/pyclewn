Writing Pyclewn Regression Tests
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The Pyclewn regression tests use the Python unittests framework.

    * run all the test cases from the distribution root directory:

            python setup.py test

    * get help on 'test' available options:

            python setup.py test --help

    * to obtain the logs of a single test in test_simple.py, for example,
      comment out all the other tests in test_main() in this file, and run the
      test file in verbose mode:

            python setup.py test --test=simple --detail

    * always start the test case by editing a file before running a Cxxx command

    * do not setup pyclewn as a daemon in a test case
