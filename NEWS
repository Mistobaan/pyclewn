XXX, 2008 - pyclewn 0.5
    New features:
        The new 'maxlines' option sets a limit on the console buffer size.
        The new 'window' option positions the console window.
        The new 'project' pyclewn command saves the current gdb settings to a
        project file that may be sourced later with the gdb 'source' command.
        These settings are the working directory, the debuggee program file
        name, the program arguments and the breakpoints.
        A new parameter to the 'gdb' option can be used to set the project file
        pathname. When set, the project file is automatically sourced on
        starting a gdb session, and the gdb settings are automatically saved to
        the project file on quitting gdb or vim.

    Changes:
        The vim implementation of the netbeans "remove" function is buggy, and
        has been fixed by patch 207 in vim 7.1. The workaround in pyclewn is to
        insert a '\n' before the line to delete, and to delete both lines in one
        shot. This workaround is not used when vim implements patch 207.
        Allow a gdb command on the initial [No name] vim window.

    Bug fixes:
        Avoid having Vim segfaults when stepping very fast with gdb, by the
        correct handling of the cursor position when restoring the cursor after
        an update of the gdb console.
        Remove the gdb tui commands.
        The 'help' command must list the pyclewn commands with the gdb commands
        only when used with no argument.


April  9, 2008 - pyclewn 0.4

    Bug fix:
        Pyclewn exits with "gdb  CRITICAL this is not a gdb program" when gdb
        writes an unexpected terminfo sequence on a subprocess pipe.
