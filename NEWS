Pyclewn 1.0
-----------

.. August 26, 2009

New features
^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Split the current Vim window and display the variables window after running
  the ``Cdbgvar`` command. This feature is enabled when the running Vim
  version is above 7.2.245 (Vim 7.2 with patch 245).


Changes
^^^^^^^

* Clean up the python debugger interface and use pydoc to document it.
* Replace the existing ``timer`` method with a flexible job scheduling.
* Replace the ``vimcmd`` environment variable with the ``EDITOR`` environment
  variable.
* Improve select emulation performance on linux by a factor of 2.
* Minimize Vim screen redraws when updating the debugger console window.
* The pyclewn sourceforge web site is now created with `sphinx
  <http://sphinx.pocoo.org/>`_ using `reStructuredText
  <http://docutils.sf.net/rst.html>`_ markup.
* Switch from Subversion to Mercurial as pyclewn Source Code Management (SCM).

Bug fixes
^^^^^^^^^

* Recent Fedora Core distributions are missing the Python standard library
  ``test.regrtest`` module. Warn that the regression test suite cannot be run
  on these platforms and continue the installation.
* Fix quoted command line arguments are not properly parsed.
* Fix content of gdbmi results within quotes must be unquoted.

Pyclewn 0.7
-----------

.. April 18, 2009

Changes
^^^^^^^

* Pyclewn falls back to pipes when a pseudo tty cannot be setup with gdb.
* On Vim 7.2 and later Vim versions, the first pyclewn command on the initial
  ``[NoName]`` buffer is ignored and an error message is printed. Also, when
  the command is issued on a buffer loaded from Vim command line, the user is
  informed that the buffer is being registered to netbeans.
* On pyclewn installation, ``gvim`` can be replaced with the value of the
  environment variable ``vimcmd``, for the pathname of the program to be run
  when checking that the ``netbeans_intg`` feature has been compiled in Vim.

Bug fixes
^^^^^^^^^

* Fix cannot run two simultaneous pyclewn sessions on the same listening port.
* Fix ``Csigint`` help and warning message when running with pipes instead of a
  pseudo tty.
* Fix incorrect display after the Vim command bdelete or bwipeout on the clewn
  console.
* Fix ``Quit`` is printed on the gdb console after the output of the next
  command.

Pyclewn 0.6
-----------

.. August 16, 2008

Changes
^^^^^^^

* Pyclewn runs on the Windows platform.

Bug fixes
^^^^^^^^^

* Fix setting or clearing a breakpoint with clewn mapped keys when the
  breakpoint file pathname includes spaces.
* Fix an assertion error that occured on exit while pyclewn is busy processing
  gdb messages. A side effect of this fix is that the project file is not saved
  automatically on exit, if gdb is busy running a command at this time.

Pyclewn 0.5
-----------

.. June 6, 2008

New features
^^^^^^^^^^^^

* The new ``maxlines`` option sets a limit on the console buffer size.
* The new ``window`` option positions the console window on top, bottom, left
  or right side of the Vim window.
* The new ``project`` pyclewn command saves the current gdb settings to a
  project file that may be sourced later with the gdb ``source`` command.
  These settings are the working directory, the debuggee program file name, the
  program arguments and the breakpoints.
* A new parameter to the ``gdb`` command line option can be used to set the
  project file pathname. When set, the project file is automatically sourced on
  starting a gdb session, and the gdb settings are automatically saved to the
  project file on quitting gdb or vim.

Changes
^^^^^^^

* The vim implementation of the netbeans "remove" function is buggy, and has
  been fixed by patch 207 in vim 7.1. The workaround in pyclewn is to insert a
  ``\n`` before the line to delete, and to delete both lines in one shot. This
  workaround is not used when vim implements patch 207.
* Allow a gdb command on the initial [No name] vim window.
* Pyclewn can be started now without setting the environment variable
  PYTHONPATH which was required in the previous release when pyclewn is
  installed locally with the ``home scheme``.

Bug fixes
^^^^^^^^^

* Avoid having Vim segfaults when stepping very fast with gdb, by the correct
  handling of the cursor position when restoring the cursor after an update of
  the gdb console.
* Remove the gdb tui commands.
* The ``help`` command must list the pyclewn commands with the gdb commands
  only when used with no argument.
* Fix incorrect breakpoint highlighting after user aborts on the dialog warning
  him that the buffer is already opened by another Vim session.

Pyclewn 0.4
-----------

.. April 9, 2008

Bug fix
^^^^^^^

* Pyclewn exits with ``gdb CRITICAL this is not a gdb program`` when gdb writes
  an unexpected terminfo sequence on a subprocess pipe.
