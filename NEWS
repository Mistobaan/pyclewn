XXX, 2008 - pyclewn 0.5

    Bug fixes:
        Avoid having Vim segfaults when stepping very fast with gdb, by the
        correct handling of the cursor position when restoring the cursor after
        an update of the gdb console.
        Enable a gdb command on the initial [No name] vim window.


April  9, 2008 - pyclewn 0.4

    Bug fix:
        Pyclewn exits with "gdb  CRITICAL this is not a gdb program" when gdb
        writes an unexpected terminfo sequence on a subprocess pipe.


March 22, 2008 - pyclewn 0.3
