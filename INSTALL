Pyclewn installation notes
==========================

Required
--------

+---------------------+-----------------------------------------------------+
| Python              | Vim                                                 |
+=====================+=====================================================+
| Python 2.7 or above | Vim 7.0 or above with the **netbeans_intg** feature |
|                     | and the  **autocmd** feature enabled (netbeans and  |
|                     | autocmd are enabled on most distributions).         |
+---------------------+-----------------------------------------------------+

To use Vim as a front-end to the pdb debugger, pyclewn requires that
``pdb-clone`` be installed separately. Install ``pdb-clone`` from PyPi at
pdb-clone_.


Install from source
-------------------

Unpack the tarball, change directory to the distribution directory and run the
setup script to install pyclewn::

    tar xzf pyclewn-2.0.tar.gz
    cd pyclewn-2.0
    python setup.py install --force

You can now use the ``:help pyclewn`` command within vim, to get access to the
documentation.

The installation process uses the environment variable EDITOR to invoke Vim
and install the pyclewn help file. ``gvim`` is used when this environment
variable is not found.

When the python version is 2.7 or older than 3.4, you must also install
``trollius`` from PyPi at trollius_.


Local installation from source
------------------------------

Use a local installation when you do not have root privileges and those are
required to install python packages or to install the vim runtime files on your
system.

Local installation of pyclewn
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Local installation of pyclewn is done using the ``user scheme``::

    python setup.py install --user

When the python version is 2.7 or older than 3.4, you must also install
``trollius`` from PyPi at trollius_.

Vim runtime files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Local installation of vim runtime files is done by setting the ``vimdir``
environment variable set to your personal vim runtime directory during
installation. For example, local installation of pyclewn and of vim runtime
files::

    vimdir=$HOME/.vim python setup.py install --user


Uninstall
---------

To uninstall pyclewn on unix, run the same command that you have been using
for installing pyclewn and record the list of files that are being installed
into ``files.txt`` with the ``--record`` option. For example::

    python setup.py install --user --record files.txt

Then remove all the installed files::

    rm $(cat files.txt)
