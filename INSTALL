INSTALL- Pyclewn installation notes

REQUIRED:
--------
    python:     python 2.4 or above
    gvim:       vim 7.0 or above
                with the 'netbeans_intg' feature enabled
                with the 'autocmd' feature enabled
                (netbeans and autocmd are enabled on most distributions)

Note that netbeans does not run on the console vim, you must use gvim.

The pyclewn installer checks the Vim version, checks that Vim has been compiled
with the 'netbeans_intg' and 'autocmd' features, and installs pyclewn help in
Vim. This is done by executing VIM as a shell command during the installation
process, with VIM being the value of the 'EDITOR' environment variable or being
"gvim" if this environment variable does not exist.


INSTALL ON UNIX:
---------------
Unpack the tarball, change directory to the distribution directory and
run the setup script to install pyclewn:

    tar xzf pyclewn-0.7.tar.gz
    cd pyclewn-0.7
    python setup.py install

You can now use the ":help pyclewn" command within vim, to access the
documentation.


LOCAL INSTALLATION ON UNIX:
--------------------------
Use a local installation when you do not have root privileges and those are
required to install python packages or to install the vim runtime files on your
system.

a) Local installation of pyclewn binaries:
    This is done using the distutils 'home scheme' as follows (pyclewn is
    installed in $HOME/bin):

        python setup.py install --home=$HOME

b) Local installation of the vim runtime files:
    This is done by setting the vimdir environment variable to your
    personal vim runtime directory during installation:

        vimdir=$HOME/.vim python setup.py install

c) Local installation of both pyclewn binaries and the vim runtime files:

        vimdir=$HOME/.vim python setup.py install --home=$HOME


INSTALL ON WINDOWS:
------------------
Pyclewn is installed with a Windows installer.

The following software must have been installed on Windows:

    * the win32 python package from http://starship.python.net/crew/mhammond/
    * MinGW and the MinGW components MSYS and gdb from http://www.mingw.org/

Gvim must be in the PATH before starting the installation, otherwise the
installation will fail. Use the Control Panel on Windows XP to add the gvim
directory to %PATH%:

    Control Panel > System > Advanced tab > Enviroment Variables > Edit "PATH"

To install pyclewn, double-click on the installer: pyclewn-0.7.win32.exe.
This will install pyclewn, configure Vim and create a shortcut on the Desktop.
The installation is complete after the following message is printed by the
installer: "pyclewn postinstall completed". You can now use the
":help pyclewn" command within vim, to access the documentation.

You may have to edit the installed shortcut (right-click > Properties) to
update the gdb full pathname when gdb has not been installed in the standard
MinGW location.

Pyclewn may be uninstalled with the Control Panel.
