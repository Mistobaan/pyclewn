INSTALL- Pyclewn installation notes

REQUIRED:
--------
    python:     python 2.4 or above
    gvim:       vim 7.0 or above
                with the 'netbeans_intg' feature enabled
                with the 'autocmd' feature enabled
		(netbeans and autocmd are enabled on most distributions)

Note that netbeans does not run on the console vim, you must use gvim.


INSTALL:
-------
Unpack the tarball, change directory to the distribution directory and
run the setup script to install pyclewn:

    # tar xzf pyclewn-0.2.tar.gz
    # cd pyclewn-0.2
    # python setup.py install

You can now use the ":help pyclewn" command within vim, to get access to
the documentation.


LOCAL INSTALLATION:
------------------
Use a local installation when you do not have root privileges and those are
required to install python packages or to install the vim runtime files on your
system.

a) Local installation of pyclewn binaries:
    This is done using the distutils 'home scheme' as follows:
    (see http://docs.python.org/inst/inst.html):

    $ python setup.py install --home=$HOME

    In that case $HOME/bin must be in your $PATH, and $HOME/lib/python
    must be in your $PYTHONPATH.

b) Local installation of the vim runtime files:
    This is done by setting the vimdir environment variable to your
    personal vim runtime directory during installation:

    $ vimdir=$HOME/.vim python setup.py install

c) Local installation of both pyclewn binaries and the vim runtime files:

    $ vimdir=$HOME/.vim python setup.py install --home=$HOME
