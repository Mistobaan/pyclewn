+------------+---------------------------------------+
| Python     | Vim                                   |
+============+=======================================+
| Python 2.4 | Vim 7.0 or above with the             |
| or above   | **netbeans_intg** feature enabled,    |
|            | and with the **autocmd** feature      |
|            | enabled                               |
|            | (netbeans and autocmd are             |
|            | enabled on most                       |
|            | distributions).                       |
+------------+---------------------------------------+

Install on unix
---------------

Unpack the tarball, change directory to the distribution directory and run the
setup script to install pyclewn::

    tar xzf pyclewn-2.0.tar.gz
    cd pyclewn-2.0
    python setup.py install --force

You can now use the ``:help pyclewn`` command within vim, to get access to the
documentation.

The installation process uses the environment variable EDITOR to invoke Vim
and install the pyclewn help file, ``gvim`` is used when this environment
variable is not found.

Local installation on unix
--------------------------

Use a local installation when you do not have root privileges and those are
required to install python packages or to install the vim runtime files on your
system.

Pyclewn binaries
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Local installation of the pyclewn binaries is done using the distutils ``home
scheme`` as follows (pyclewn is installed in $HOME/bin)::

    python setup.py install --force --home=$HOME

Vim runtime files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Local installation of the runtime file is done by setting the ``vimdir``
environment variable set to your personal vim runtime directory during
installation::

    vimdir=$HOME/.vim python setup.py install --force

Both binaries and runtime
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Local installation of the pyclewn binaries and the runtime file is done with
the command::

    vimdir=$HOME/.vim python setup.py install --force --home=$HOME

Uninstall on unix
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To uninstall pyclewn on unix, run the same command that you have been using
for installing pyclewn and record into ``files.txt`` the list of files that
are being installed with the ``--record`` option. For example::

    python setup.py install --force --home=$HOME --record files.txt

Then remove all the installed files::

    rm $(cat files.txt)
