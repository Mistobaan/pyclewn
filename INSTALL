+---------------------+-----------------------------------------------------+
| Python              | Vim                                                 |

| Python 2.7 or       | Vim 7.0 or above with the **netbeans_intg** feature |
| Python 3.1 or newer | and the  **autocmd** feature enabled (netbeans and  |
|                     | autocmd are enabled on most distributions).         |
+---------------------+-----------------------------------------------------+


Quick start
-----------

A two steps installation.

1) Install the Python package::

    sudo pip install pyclewn

This command installs the ``clewn`` package and its dependencies.

2) Install the Vim runtime files with a vimball. First create the
``pyclewn-2.0.vmb`` vimball in the current directory with the command::

    python -c "import clewn; clewn.get_vimball()"

Then source the vimball and install the Vim runtime files with::

    vim -S pyclewn-2.0.vmb


Installing with pip
-------------------

The preferred method to install pyclewn is pip_, see above. pip is
automatically installed with Python version 3.4 and newer. It is available on
most linux distributions as a package and otherwise it is easy to install
manually, see pip_.

pip will also install ``pdb-clone``.

pip will also install ``trollius`` and its dependencies on Python 2.7 or on
Python versions older than 3.4.

Use a local installation when you do not have root privileges and those are
required to install Python packages::

    pip install --user pyclewn

The ``pyclewn-2.0.vmb`` vimball is a data file, part of the ``clewn`` package,
and can be obtained at any time with::

    python -c "import clewn; clewn.get_vimball()"

The vimball contains the following runtime files::

    autoload/pyclewn.vim            # The pyclewn plugin.
    plugin/pyclewn.vim
    doc/pyclewn.txt                 # The help.
    syntax/clewn_variables.vim      # The (clewn)_variables syntax file.
    macros/.pyclewn_keys.gdb        # The 'Cmapkeys' files.
    macros/.pyclewn_keys.pdb
    macros/.pyclewn_keys.simple

See the vimball documentation with the vim command ``:help vimball``.


Installing from source
----------------------

Unpack the tarball, change directory to the distribution directory and run the
setup script to install pyclewn::

    tar xzf pyclewn-2.0.tar.gz
    cd pyclewn-2.0
    sudo python setup.py install

To use Vim as a front-end to the pdb debugger, pyclewn requires that
``pdb-clone`` be installed separately. So optionally install ``pdb-clone``
from PyPI at pdb-clone_.

When the Python version is 2.7 or older than 3.4, you MUST also install
``trollius`` from PyPI at trollius_.

Use a local installation when you do not have root privileges and those are
required to install Python packages::

    python setup.py install --user

The runtime files must also be installed as described in the first section.
The ``pyclewn-2.0.vmb`` vimball can be found in the ``lib/clewn/runtime``
directory of the tarball.
