+============+=======================================+
| python 2.4 | Vim 7.0 or above with the             |

|            | and with the **autocmd** feature      |

+------------+---------------------------------------+

Install on unix
---------------

Unpack the tarball, change directory to the distribution directory and run the
setup script to install pyclewn::

    tar xzf pyclewn-1.2.tar.gz
    cd pyclewn-1.2
    python setup.py install --force

You can now use the ``:help pyclewn`` command within vim, to get access to the
documentation.


Local installation on unix
--------------------------

Use a local installation when you do not have root privileges and those are
required to install python packages or to install the vim runtime files on your
system.

Pyclewn binaries
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Local installation of the pyclewn binaries is done using the distutils ``home
scheme`` as follows (pyclewn is installed in $HOME/bin)::

    python setup.py install --force --home=$HOME

Vim runtime files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Local installation of the runtime file is done by setting the ``vimdir``
environment variable set to your personal vim runtime directory during
installation::

    vimdir=$HOME/.vim python setup.py install --force

Both binaries and runtime
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Local installation of the pyclewn binaries and the runtime file is done with
the command::

    vimdir=$HOME/.vim python setup.py install --force --home=$HOME

Install on Windows
------------------

Pyclewn is installed with a Windows installer.

The following software must have been installed on Windows:

* the win32 python package from http://starship.python.net/crew/mhammond/
* MinGW and the MinGW components MSYS and gdb from http://www.mingw.org/

Vim must be in the PATH before starting the installation, otherwise the
installation will fail. Use the Control Panel on Windows XP to add the vim
directory to ``%PATH%``::

    Control Panel > System > Advanced tab
    Advanced tab > Environment Variables > Edit "PATH"

On Vista, add the ``PATH`` environment variable to your account, and set its
value to::

    C:\path\to\vim72;%PATH%

To install pyclewn, double-click on the installer: pyclewn-1.2.win32.exe. This
will install pyclewn, configure Vim and create a shortcut on the Desktop. The
installation is complete after the following message is printed by the
installer: ``pyclewn postinstall completed``. You can now use the ``:help
pyclewn`` command within vim, to access the documentation.

You may have to edit the installed shortcut (right-click > Properties) to
update the gdb full pathname when gdb has not been installed in the standard
MinGW location.

Pyclewn may be uninstalled with the Control Panel.

Please note that the installation will fail when you upgrade to version 1.0 if
you did not uninstall the previous pyclewn version with the Control Panel.
This will not be required when upgrading to the next versions.
